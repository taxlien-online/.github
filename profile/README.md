# Tax Lien Online

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **Tax Lien Online**, a project dedicated to managing and investing in tax liens and deeds. This repository provides resources, documentation, and tools for understanding and engaging with tax lien investments.

## Overview

In the United States, tax liens and deeds are two types of legal instruments that serve as mechanisms for collecting unpaid property taxes. 

### Tax Lien
A **Tax Lien** is a claim placed on a property by a government authority when the owner (referred to as "Owner") fails to pay property taxes on time. The tax lien can be sold to investors, granting them the right to earn interest on the unpaid taxes.

#### Key Points:
- **No Priority for Property Ownership:** The investor does not have preferential rights to acquire the property.
- If the owner pays the overdue taxes after the lien is sold:
  - The lien is redeemed.
  - The investor receives the invested amount plus a premium (typically ~10% annualized, varying by state).
- If the owner fails to pay, the property may be auctioned. Auction proceeds are used to satisfy outstanding obligations when possible.
- **Profitability:**
  - Maximized when the lien is redeemed promptly.
  - Delays in redemption are less favorable.
  - Non-redemption may result in losses.

### Tax Deed
A **Tax Deed** is similar to a tax lien but grants the investor preferential rights to acquire the property if taxes remain unpaid.

#### Key Points:
- **Priority for Property Ownership:** The investor gains the right to claim the property if the owner fails to settle the tax debt.
- After a minimum waiting period, if the owner still hasnâ€™t paid:
  - The investor can initiate proceedings to acquire the property.
- **Profitability:**
  - Maximized when the property is acquired.
  - Redemption by the owner is less favorable.

## How It Works
1. When a property owner fails to pay taxes, the government issues a tax lien or deed.
2. The lien or deed is sold at auction or on the open market to investors (including us).
3. Outcomes depend on whether the owner settles the tax debt:
   - If paid: The lien or deed is redeemed, and the investor receives their investment plus interest.
   - If unpaid: The property may be acquired by the investor (for deeds) or auctioned.
